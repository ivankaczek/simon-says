Simon Says coded using Vanilla JavaScript

Step #1: Create the 4 coloured buttons and the 'start' button

I create 4 simple html buttons with different class names in order to apply CSS styles
I also define a 'selected' class to show when a button is pressed (it simply goes white with a black border)

Step #2: Show the 1st random button

Function #1: select a Button.

This function changes the class of the button for a few seconds in order to indicate that this button should be pressed

Simon Says coded using Vanilla JavaScript

Step #1: Create the 4 coloured buttons and the 'start' button

I create 4 simple html buttons with different class names in order to apply CSS styles
I also define a 'selected' class to show when a button is pressed (it simply goes white with a black border)

Step #2: Show the 1st random button

I need a function that shows that this button should be pressed. Then I need another function to be sure that a random button out of those 4 is selected.

Function #1: select a Button.

This function changes the class of the button for a few seconds in order to indicate that this button should be pressed
